## 🏢 About Us

**Rayan Pardaz Molaanaa** is a specialized software engineering firm dedicated to building high-performance decentralized applications (dApps). We refuse to compromise on user experience.

While the industry trends toward cross-platform frameworks, we specialize in **Native Mobile Architecture**. We believe that financial tools require the hardware-level optimization and cryptographic security that only native **Kotlin (Android)** and **Swift (iOS)** can provide.

Our mission is to bridge the gap between complex blockchain backends and elegant, pixel-perfect mobile interfaces.
